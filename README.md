# ‚úçüèº Author's Note
Hi, I'm Francisco Monroy, and this vault is a significant part of my transition from pursuing a Ph.D. In preparation for dropping out of a structured academic program (in June 2024) has led me to create a system that supports the complexity my day-to-day tasks and long-term goals.

This project is not just a tool I use personally, but also a means to connect with and support others on similar journeys. I hope this vault provides as much value to you as it has to me.
