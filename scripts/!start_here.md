This folder holds .js scripts. They are hidden by default in obsidian. Do not delete this folder if you want to keep the QuickAdd macros that automate creating yearly/monthly folders and creating daily notes (with [[template day]]) and weekly notes (with [[template week]]).

Hotkey reminder:
- Create folder structure for the year: `Opt-Y`
- Create files for each day of the week and a weekly file that follow [[template day]] and [[template week]]: `Opt-W`
