 Welcome to this comprehensive guide to mastering Obsidian! This vault is crafted to familiarize you with all the important options Obsidian has to offer. Below, you will find a complete list of all settings, hotkeys, and plugins that constitute the core of Obsidian's customizability.

Feel free to interact with this list, marking off items as you explore them, and revisit as often as you like to ensure you are leveraging all that Obsidian has to offer. This is your journey toward a more efficient and personalized project and digital knowledge system. Don't hesitate to experiment with different settings and plugins to find what best suits your unique workflow.

All customization options are available from the settings menu (in the lower left corner). To get started, explore the setting options below while testing them in the settings menu. It is recommended to have a copy of the vault open side-by-side to view changes.
# Options
- [ ] [[Editor]]
- [ ] [[Files & Links]]

Once you feel comfortable with the settings and plugins, jump into the project management section, which follows the Getting Things Done productivity system by David Allen: [[Command Center/!start_here|!start_here]].


**Note**, your files may be out of order on the left side bar by default. Click the *custom sorting* icon to organize the files as I intended:

and then click the *Manage workspace layouts* icon and select *obsidian_start* to adjust the left side bar to show the vault directory if you cannot find the *Files* icon -- it may require side scrolling.
