## Recurring Tasks:
Set up tasks that are recurring for a project here, as recurring tasks tend to pile up. We will also use the plugin "Packrat" to manage recurring tasks. Packrat will delete all completed tasks with the tag `#pr1` and place all tasks with the tag `#pr2` at the end of the file.
- [ ] deleted tasks #pr1 🔁 every day 🛫 2023-12-30 📅 2023-12-30
- [ ] logged to end of file tasks #pr2 🔁 every day 🛫 2023-12-30 📅 2023-12-30
