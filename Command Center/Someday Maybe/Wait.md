# Brief Description
**A brief description of the idea, task, or project. This should be clear and concise, giving you a quick understanding of what the item is about**:
I don't know if I should implement a wait note for tasks. Maybe see how current system holds up and come back to this if needed.

# Skills and Resources Needed
**List any skills you need to develop or resources required to accomplish the task or project. This helps in planning for future learning or resource allocation**:
NA.

# Notes/Details
**Any additional information, thoughts, or details about the idea. This could include links to resources, why the idea appealed to you, or any other relevant information**:

1. **Task**: A clear description of the task or action item.
2. **Reason for Waiting**: Why the task is on hold (e.g., waiting for someone's response, pending a specific date or event, awaiting resources).
3. **Date Added**: When the task was added to the list. This helps track how long a task has been waiting.
4. **Follow-up Date**: The date you plan to check back or follow up on this task. This is critical for ensuring tasks donâ€™t get indefinitely delayed.
5. **Dependency**: Any specific dependencies that need to be resolved before the task can progress. This could be a person, an event, a decision, etc.
6. **Priority Level**: Although these are waiting tasks, some might be more urgent than others. Assigning a priority level can help manage them effectively.
7. **Contact Person/Entity**: If the task depends on someone else (like a colleague, a client, or a service provider), include their contact information for easy reference.
8. **Notes/Comments**: Additional details or updates about the task. This can include changes in status, relevant communications, or other pertinent information.
9. **Action Required**: What needs to be done once the waiting period is over or the dependency is resolved. This helps in transitioning the task back into your active to-do list.
10. **Resolution Date**: When the task is resolved or moved out of the waiting list. This helps in tracking the efficiency and timelines of your pending tasks.
