Welcome to the project management section of this vault! This area is designed to enhance productivity and efficiently manage your projects, drawing inspiration from the Getting Things Done (GTD) methodology. This system offers a clear and adaptable framework for managing tasks, information, and plans. Each component is crafted to assist you in capturing, organizing, and executing your ideas and responsibilities effectively.

Dive into each section to see how it contributes to an overarching system of effective project and knowledge management. This section is your guide to mastering the GTD methodology within Obsidian, helping you maintain control over your tasks and objectives.

# Workflow:
The workflow begins with inboxes, serving as collection points for unprocessed tasks and ideas. An inbox can be any location where you store unfinished tasks that occupy space in your mind. Often, people try to use their memory as an inbox, which can increase stress. Designated inboxes are crucial for capturing thoughts and actionable items. See **Structure of System** below for my personal structure as an example.

Once items are collected, they must be processed. They can be categorized as either actionable or inactionable. Inactionable items typically need to be archived, added to your library, placed into a relevant project (or 'effort') folder, or discarded if deemed unnecessary. Actionable tasks can be classified into three types:
1. **Immediate Tasks**: Tasks that take less than 2 minutes to complete. These should be done immediately or delegated if you're not the best person for the job.
2. **Intermediate Tasks**: Tasks that take more than 2 minutes. These can be soft scheduled (added to a daily to-do list), hard scheduled (assigned a specific date and time on the calendar), or delegated.
3. **Multi-Step Tasks (Efforts)**: More complex tasks or projects. If these are not urgent or important, such as bucket list goals, they can be placed in 'Someday/Maybe'. Important efforts require thorough processing. Depending on their complexity and duration, you might find the effort template and the seven areas of wellness beneficial for setting up and managing these projects. See **Individual Effort Folder/File Structure** and **Seven Areas of Wellness Effort Management** below.

This workflow is designed to ensure that nothing gets lost and every task is given the attention it requires. It's a dynamic and adaptable system.

# Structure of System:
My personal approach to managing information involves a structured system that accommodates various 'pools'/places for storage of information. Having a well-defined organization helps streamline productivity, even though there may be instances when we deviate from the system. To maintain order, I recommend setting regular intervals—weekly, monthly, or quarterly—to review and tidy up your files.

# Individual Effort Folder/File Structure:
For individual projects, I follow a consistent structure with the use of templates. This structure ensures thorough planning, tracking, and review of each project:
#### 1. Project Charter
- **[[templates/template effort/1_charter/0 Overview| Overview]]**:
	- One sentence summary - The 'About' sentence to make this mostly clear to a reader.
	- Purpose and principles - The 'why' of the project and guiding principles or constraints.
	- Outcome visioning - Visualization of the desired outcome and definition of success. The 'what' of the project.
- **[[templates/template effort/1_charter/1 Brainstorm| Brainstorm]]**: Brainstorm the 'how' of the project.
- **[[templates/template effort/1_charter/2 Budget & Resources| Budget & Resources]]**: Budget details and list of necessary resources.
#### 2. Planning and Strategy
- **[[templates/template effort/2_plan_strategy/0 Timeline & Milestones| Timeline & Milestones]]**: Outline of key dates, milestones, and deadlines.
- **[[templates/template effort/2_plan_strategy/1 Action Plan| Action Plan]]**: Detailed breakdown of tasks, including who, what, and when.
- **[[templates/template effort/2_plan_strategy/2 Progress Tracking| Progress Tracking]]**: Regular updates and logs of ongoing work. This focuses on the status of tasks and milestones.
#### 3. Research & Development
- **[[templates/template effort/3_research_dev/learning_resources/Learning Resources| Learning Resources]]**: Essential materials for understanding or developing the project.
- **[[templates/template effort/3_research_dev/notes_ideas/Notes and Ideas| Notes and Ideas]]**: Brainstorming results, notes, and innovative thoughts.
- **[[templates/template effort/3_research_dev/files_docs/Files and Documents| Files and Documents]]**: All initial research files, documents, and early drafts.
#### 4. Review & Adjustment
- **[[templates/template effort/4_review_adjust/Self-Evaluation| Self-Evaluation]]**: Periodic assessment of the project's progress against goals, examining both successes and areas needing improvement.
- **[[templates/template effort/4_review_adjust/Improvement Plan| Improvement Plan]]**: Strategies and actions for enhancing the project, adjusting the approach based on evaluations.
#### 5. Communication & Collaboration
- **[[templates/template effort/5_comm_collab/Contacts and Communication| Contacts and Communication]]**: Information about project-related contacts and summaries of key communications.
- **[[templates/template effort/5_comm_collab/Feedback and Collaboration| Feedback and Collaboration]]**: Notes on feedback received and records of collaborative efforts.
#### 6. Finalization & Archiving
- **[[templates/template effort/6_final_archive/final_outputs/Final Outputs| Final Outputs]]**: The completed work, final deliverables, and presentations.
- **[[templates/template effort/6_final_archive/archive/Archive| Archive]]**: Storage of all project versions, documents, and important materials for future reference.
- **[[templates/template effort/6_final_archive/Future Enhancements| Future Enhancements]]**: Ideas and potential improvements for future projects or extensions of the current project.

Each link above is a file and step to complete. This template guides and supports project development from inception to completion. To create a new project, copy the `templates/template effort` folder (*right click > copy folder*), rename it, and place it into the appropriate efforts category.


# Seven Areas of Wellness Effort Management:
Projects are categorized and managed according to the seven areas of wellness to ensure a holistic approach to productivity and personal development. For a broad overview of all ongoing efforts, visit the **[[Effort Dashboard]]**. Each project, however, is tracked and managed individually, allowing for detailed task oversight and progress tracking.

# Day-to-Day Scheduling
Effective project management is complemented by efficient day-to-day scheduling. The Planner folder in our vault is structured to facilitate this:
- Planner
  - YYYY
    - YYYY-MM
      - WW
        - YYYY-MM-DD.md (Daily Notes/To Dos)
        - WW.md (Weekly Summary/Review)

This structure allows for weekly planning and is extendable for long-term projects. Use the hotkey `Opt-Y` to set up the folder structure. The files for a given week (`YYYY-MM-DD.md` and `WW.md`) are based on the [[template day]] and [[template week]] templates, respectively, and can be created using the hotkey `Opt-W`. If you prefer a more flexible approach, you can delete the `YYYY` folder and use `Opt-W` for individual weeks. For more details, see [[QuickAdd]].

In the current [[template day]], tasks are categorized into three types:
1. **Daily (Inherent) Tasks:** These are routine tasks that rarely change. (_For example, self-care reminders like brushing teeth._)
2. **Recurring Tasks:** These often originate from ongoing efforts. For instance, an effort like [[Learn C]] might include studying for an hour daily. Routine tasks, such as sanitizing a toothbrush or washing bed sheets, are also part of this category.
3. **Soft Scheduled Tasks:** These tasks can arise on the day itself or be planned during our weekly review.

# Weekly Review #task
*Stay tuned for more enhancements! This system covers about 90 to 95% of the GTD methodology, allowing you to customize it further to your needs. However, if you're looking for a complete, ready-to-use vault, I plan to offer a refined and thoroughly tested version in February 2024 for just $5. Remember, competing options are much more expensive*:
- [Obsidian Flight School - Online course](https://www.linkingyourthinking.com/obsidian-flight-school#overview) - $129 (I purchased this, but if you follow the instructions in [[start_here/!start_here|!start_here]], you probably won't need it.)
- [Ideaverse Pro](https://www.linkingyourthinking.com/ideaverse-pro#pricing) - $250 (I've reviewed the free version, Ideaverse Zero, and found it didn't suit my needs.)
- [Obsidian for Everyone](https://courses.nicolevanderhoeven.com/o4e) - $200 (Most of what's covered in this course is also addressed in this vault, particularly in [[start_here/!start_here|!start_here]].)

_Future Enhancements:_
- Light theme. Currently, only supports night/dark mode.
- Windows-compatibility? Hotkeys are not tested on Windows, so `Ctrl` and `Cmd` conflicts may exist.
- Filled in examples or extending notes community plugins: 
	- [[Tasks]] - Task management within the knowledge base.
	- [[QuickAdd]] - Combination of templates, captures, macros, and multis.
	- [[Templater]] - A template plugin for Obsidian.
	- [[Metadata Menu]] - Manage the metadata of notes.
	- [[Dataview]] - Advanced queries for data management.
	- [[DB Folder]] - Database-like management based on folders.
	- [[Advanced Tables]] - Improved navigation and formatting for markdown tables.
	- [[File Order]] - Reorder files with drag-and-drop.
	- [[Tag Wrangler]] - Rename, merge, toggle, and search tags from the Obsidian tag pane.
	- [[Enhance Note Copy]] - 
- Weekly, Quarterly, and Yearly Review documentation
- Notes on taking notes and the process of integrating archived effort notes into library. For example, if you have taken notes for *English 101*, how to refine your notes and then storing them in your library of notes.

_Personal Note:_ As I transition from pursuing a Ph.D. to forging my own path (read, dropping out), this system/vault is not just a tool I personally use, but also a means to support myself. By taking a few extra steps to package and share this work, I hope to provide substantial value for free and appreciate any support you can offer. Thank you!
