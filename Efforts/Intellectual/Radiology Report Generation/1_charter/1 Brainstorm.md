### Brainstorming:
**Instructions:**
	**- The aim of this brainstorm is to explore various ways how the project can be accomplished.**
	**- Choose whatever brainstorming methods works for you, e.g. mind mapping, free writing, etc.**
	**- Write down all ideas without judgement. Focus on the quantity of ideas over quality.**
	**- At the end of the session, start to develop an initial plan**

To get started, I need to read 5 papers in literature. Preferably, papers that are at the top and have code. Understand the papers, and understand the data and control flow of the code.
Need to take the 8 hour pytorch course.
Get hands on datasets.
Want to get through the 5 papers within a month.
Things i need to get clearer to me:
- What benchmarks to aim for?

What journals to publish to? Should i make this a list that I can reference for newest reseasrch?
Compile a comprehensive report analyzing the current landscape of large language models, focusing on market demands, emerging trends, and potential niches for new startups. This report should offer insights into viable opportunities for future entrepreneurial endeavors, based on the knowledge and experience gained from the project. The aim is to identify specific areas where there is potential for innovation or unmet needs, providing a roadmap for possible future startup initiatives.
- Use businesses databases from school.
	- Make a list that I can referencei in the future?
Something else to consider is to use this ML model in a prototype -- an app or website? Some sort of landing page and see if anyone bites?
Plan a thorough documentation process for both the development and learning phases

### Initial Plan:
**Instructions:**
	**- Start to organize your brainstorm notes and plan the project.**
	**- What are the key milestones and deliverables?**
		**- Identify next actions and add them to [[Efforts/Intellectual/Radiology Report Generation/2_plan_strategy/1 Action Plan|1 Action Plan]] and [[Efforts/Intellectual/Radiology Report Generation/2_plan_strategy/0 Timeline & Milestones|0 Timeline & Milestones]].**
	**- Other things to think about:**
		**- What are the sub-projects? In what sequence must they be accomplished?**
		**- What are the priorities?**
		**- Think about logistics, people, and location.**

- Milestone 0 - Ramp up:
	- Complete an 8-hour PyTorch class. Document key learnings for future reference.
	- Take additional classes on numpy, sci-kit, etc as needed. Keep detailed notes.
	- Read and analyze the dataset paper. Request access and take notes.
	- Selecte 5 leading papers for review. Validate selections with student/
	- Thoroughly read papers and understand their code. Document benchmarks, datasets, common processing techniques, etc.
	- Generate questions and ideas for application in the project.
	- Begin report drafting. Specify outline and specifics of each section.
- Milestone 1 - Understand current work:
	- Review student's relevant papers and delve into existing code
	- Set up and experiment with current model.
	- Document findings, challenges, and potential improvements
	- Update report with insights. Start to research aspects of the report.
- Milestone 2 - Enhance current model
	- Collaborate with the student to define specific enhancement tasks.
	- Implement improvements and track changes.
	- Continue to update report
- Milestone 3 - Document (publish and report)
	- Write the research paper with the student
	- Final my own report. Conclude the report with comprehensive insights from the entire project. Focus on market analysis, emerging trends, and potential startup opportunities
