The Disk Utility tool is useful for managing and maintaining drives. Its key functionalities include:
- **Partitioning and Splitting Volumes:** Ideal for creating separate volumes for different purposes, such as setting up Boot Camp or organizing data.
- **Troubleshooting Disk Health/Issues:** It can diagnose and resolve various disk-related problems.
- **Formatting Drives:** Disk Utility can format drives to different file systems, making it useful for preparing storage devices for specific uses.

A particularly handy tip for those using thumb drives across different operating systems: format them to exFAT to ensure compatibility with both macOS and Windows.
