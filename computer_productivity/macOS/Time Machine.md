Time Machine is a vital tool for macOS users, offering a straightforward way to back up your entire system and access previous versions of files, functioning similarly to version control. Here's the process I used to set up Time Machine on my Mac:
- **Encrypt Backups:** Ensure that all backups are encrypted for added security.
- **Backup Drive Size:** Use a backup drive with at least 4 times the memory of my Mac to accommodate comprehensive backups.
- **Backup Frequency:** Schedule backups to occur every week to maintain up-to-date data protection.
- **Monthly Backup of Main Drive:** On a monthly basis, back up the primary backup drive for redundancy.

My future plans include looking into options for cloud backups in addition to using Time Machine for redundancy purposes (in case of fire, flooding, drive breaking, etc).
