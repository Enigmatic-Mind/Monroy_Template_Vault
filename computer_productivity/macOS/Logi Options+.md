Logitech has many keyboards and mouses that offer additional software customization options. I've found using an external board is incredibly useful for my dual-screen setup with my Mac and an external monitor. Since both screens are at eye level, using the Mac's keyboard isn't possible. 
I have not tested many keyboards; in fact, I was gifted the [MX Keys Combo](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/combos/mx-keys-combo-business-gen-2.920-010923.html) for an internship, and I have kept it ever since as I don't feel I need anything more. After two years, it still holds a charge for about 1-2 weeks (initially, it was 3-4 weeks), and the keyboard keys have a satisfying springy feel. There's also a wide range of software customization options, which I'll detail below:

# Mouse Customization
**Note:** *If you plan to use the 'Flow' feature to switch between computers, set this up first, as configuring it later might require resetting preferences.*
## Buttons Settings
Options:
- **Forward**: Default setting.
- **Back**: Default setting.
- **Horizontal scroll**: Default setting.
- **Gestures**: Default setting.
- **Middle Button**: Currently undecided. I'm observing my workflow to determine the most useful action.
- **Shift wheel mode**: Also undecided, pending workflow analysis.

## Flow
For setting up Flow, I recommend this tutorial: [Setup & Configure Logitech Flow with Logi Options Plus Beta - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRZGvMDzCto)

Note, I had an issue setting up Flow because my windows computer was not being detected. To resolve this, I:
- Made sure to uninstall any existing/previous LogiTech software.
- Install LogiTech Options+ on both computers
- Connect USB to main computer on channel 1
- Connect secondary computer via bluetooth on channel 2 to both devices
- Delete the folders at the paths specified in the image below
- Restart LogiTech Options+ on both computers

# Keyboard Customization
You can customize the top row of keys with many options, especially when using smart actions.

### Smart Actions:
- **Trigger:** Can be a mouse click or keyboard press.
- **Action:** Choose from application-related actions, keystrokes, typing text, or system commands. Multiple actions can be combined.

#### Personal Customization:
So far, I've only customized the play/pause button. I often listen to music while working, and this customization allows me to control Spotify directly. I've had an issue of wanting to pause my music to watch a video, but the play/pause button only works for the active window. With smart actions, I can make this button specific to Spotify.
