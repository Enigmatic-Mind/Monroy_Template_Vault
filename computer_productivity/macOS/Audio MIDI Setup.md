As someone who frequently records and shares my screen, the Audio MIDI Setup tool could be useful in managing audio sources. This tool allows for the configuration and control of audio inputs and outputs, which is particularly useful for recording setups and ensuring optimal audio quality during screen sharing sessions.

Currently, I don't an immediate need. However, given its potential relevance to my activities, I plan to revisit and explore the Audio MIDI Setup more thoroughly in the future.
