The Shortcuts tool on macOS enables users to craft efficient, streamlined action through custom shortcuts. These shortcuts are quick methods to accomplish multi-step actions with your apps, significantly reducing the time and effort involved in repetitive actions. Here are some examples of shortcuts I've found useful:
- **Hide Desktop:** This shortcut, as demonstrated at the 2:28 mark in the third video, allows for quick tidying of the desktop, especially useful during presentations or screen sharing.
- **Hide Downloads and Clear History:** A potential shortcut idea to maintain privacy and organization, particularly beneficial while recording, streaming, and presenting.
