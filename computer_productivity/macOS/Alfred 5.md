[Alfred - Productivity App for macOS](https://www.alfredapp.com) is a highly customizable search bar application that can significantly enhance your productivity. Given its extensive customization options, I'll cover the essentials to get you started and refer you to comprehensive resources for deeper exploration. A list of default and customized hotkeys for Alfred can be found at [[Complete List of Hotkeys]].

# General Settings
For the general setttings, I changed the hotkey to Cmd-Space. This required turning off Mac's Spotlight in Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > Spotlight.

# Workflows Settings
Workflows in Alfred are akin to Mac's shortcuts or Automator, enabling multi-step routine tasks with a button click. Here are some standard workflows I use:

## Downloaded Workflows
[Alfred Gallery • Workflows • Convert](https://alfred.app/workflows/giovanni/convert/)
[Alfred Gallery • Workflows • Unit Converter](https://alfred.app/workflows/alfredapp/unit-converter/)
[Alfred Gallery • Workflows • Shimmering Obsidian](https://alfred.app/workflows/chrisgrieser/shimmering-obsidian/)
[Alfred Gallery • Workflows • Temporary Email](https://alfred.app/workflows/vitor/temporary-email/)

## Custom Workflows
I have not set up my personal workflows yet, but some I have in mind:
- save link to a specific category instead of just bookmarking it
- link to mac shortcuts for:
	- hiding desktop files
	- hiding download files before this second (for demonstrations and presentations)
- opening a browser file with no history
- obsidian:
	- open up daily note (at a specific path)
- OBS (YouTube Streaming)
	- Log to a file when I need to filter out something I showed
	- Pause recording
	- Log timestamp of changing topics
